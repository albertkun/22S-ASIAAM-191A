# Clone a new repo

We will be working with the terminal a bit today, so let's open up the terminal by going to the menu bar:

Then clicking on `New Terminal`:

Start by cloning this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/albertkun/22s-AA191-GitPracticing.git
```

Here are the basic git commands for adding new changes:

```
git add .
git commit -am "message"
git push
```

These commands are identical to what we do in the source control tab in VS Code:

1. Is the `git add .`
2. Is the `git commit` with a `message`
3. Is the `git push`
