# Collaborating with GitHub and Plugins

The goal of this lab is to get more familiar with coding for your final group projects.
l
!!! tldr "Goals"
    - Clone a new repository
    - Create a new branch
    - Add a new Leaflet plugin
    - Create a pull request
    - Install and test the live share extension

This lab will start by cloning a new repository from the `git practicing repo` here:

- https://github.com/albertkun/22S-AA191-GitPracticing/

The git link to be cloned is here:

```
https://github.com/albertkun/22s-AA191-GitPracticing.git
```

This is similar to what you would do for cloning your group projects if you have not done so already.
