# Collaborating with GitHub and Plugins

Today we will focus on styling our map through the use of Leaflet [`Feature groups`](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#featuregroup), which means more JavaScript!

`Feature groups` are like containers that you can use to group your map content. For this lab we will be creating two layers for our survey question of `"Is your English your first language?"`

One group will be for `yes` and another group for `no`.

!!! tldr "Goals"
    - Install and test the live share extension
    - Clone a new repository
    - Create a new branch
    - Create a pull request

The goal of this lab is to get more familiar with coding for your final group projects.

This lab will start by cloning a new repository, this is similar to what you would do for cloning your group projects if you have not done so already.
