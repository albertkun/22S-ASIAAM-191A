# Final Lab Exercise

Join up with your group. With the remaining time, look at some of the plugins below and try to implement them into your mapplication or your own group projects:

## UI

- https://github.com/noerw/leaflet-sidebar-v2

- https://github.com/mapshakers/leaflet-control-window

- https://cliffcloud.github.io/Leaflet.Sleep/
  
## Markers

- https://github.com/mapshakers/leaflet-icon-pulse

- https://dagjomar.github.io/Leaflet.ParallaxMarker/

- https://wbkd.github.io/leaflet-swoopy/

## Others

- https://github.com/albertkun/leaflet_hex_timeslider

Leave a review of **one** of them in the Git-Practicing Repo:
- https://github.com/albertkun/22S-AA191-GitPracticing/blob/main/review.md

Feel free to try others not in this list and add it to the doc.

Pay attention to how important good documentation is and how your own group projects `readme.md` should be structured. Creating a `branch` will be helpful when testing new features. Refer to [lab 8](../week8/index.md) for a refresher on branches.
