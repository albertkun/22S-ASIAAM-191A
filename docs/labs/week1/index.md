![](././media/intro.png)
## Objectives

!!! tldr "Goals"
    - Create a basic webpage 
    - Add a Leaflet map
    - Add GeoJSON data to the map
    - Create a GeoJSON online

!!! caution "Reminder"
    The [pre-lab](../../assignments/week1/prelab) must completed before attempting this lab.


This lab will walk you through the process of creating a static web page in HTML with some additional style elements using CSS. Then you will be tasked to add a map using the [Leaflet JS library](https://www.leafletjs.com/) and host it using GitHub pages.

>Note: I highly recommend checking out the [Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html). Looking at any documentation before choosing any software is important, because badly documented libraries can make tools difficult to use.
